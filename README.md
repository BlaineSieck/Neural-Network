Information Retrieval Final Project README
Convolutional Neural Network
Blaine Sieck, Brigham Muench, and Terran King

Contributions:
We worked together via video chat and screen share to work on the code collaboratively so everyone contributed equally.

**Important Note**
- If you have trouble running the program with the instructions below, I have provided a video link to the program running on my computer: https://youtu.be/BsMRyI2cBfA

Python Version: 3.6

*We ran everything through an anaconda environment but importing these libraries should work as well*

Libraries Used: 
- Keras
- Tensorflow
- Matplotlib
- Numpy
- Pillow
- Plotly
- Tensorflow-hub
- os

How to run the program:

- If you have all of the required libraries imported and the dataset in the project folder you should be able to run the program from your IDE (we used Pycharm)

- If you use an anaconda environment just open the terminal with that environment and navigate to the project folder directory and type the command “python convnet.py” for our neural network code or “python convnet-transfer.py” for the transfer learning neural network with MobileNet V2 (requires an internet connection)
